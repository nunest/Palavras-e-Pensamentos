# Green Thumb Story

For a relevant period of time I had easy access to land. My family all has green thumbs, and they grought them to good use in our plots.

We had potatoes, vegetable gardens, and fruit trees.
During this period I did not value it much, maybe because I was in my teens and we tend to be a bit too full of our selves and think we have a new better way for everything when we go through that age.

After I moved to a big city and lost access to these privileges I quickly realied how important they were to me, and how much pleasure those things brought to me.

Since then I have started things from seed in pots, balconies, and later on in small plots of land around my house.

Now I live in Sweden and as we moved to our house the plans to create a vegetable garden started immediately.

We converted a piece of our lawn into a vegetable garden. To do this I used the no dig method which I had been following for quite some time on Charles Dowding's YouTube channel.

The first year we had some tomatoes, lettuce, cabbages, and many other different nice vegetables. Those first couple of time have shown me that I should be better at keeping track of what and how much I should plant in our garden. It is easy to get fascinated by some vegetable, or to try and get all sorts of vegetable instead of focusing on the things you will actually consume and enjoy. Also it makes sense to keep track of what works for each type of plant.

I was used to a different type of climate in Portugal, that had a larger grow season and less extreme climate.

# Greenhouse

After a couple of seasons we got a little greenhouse, the purpose was to use it as a way to start the season earlier with seedlings without filling up the window sills or the outside room.

The problem with the small greenhouse its that is was just as cold as the outside, only preventing frost, but not the low temperatures. This means germinations were very low, and plants would get stunted or die.

So this year I decided to do 2 things: wrap the greenhouse with bubble wrap to provide a little more insulation, and keep the seedlings on heat mats while they need it.
